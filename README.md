# stroke_prediction
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

All the features we had:

•	id: unique identifier 
•	gender: “Male,” “Female,” or “Other.” 
•	age: age of the patient 
•	hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn’t have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension 
•	heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn’t have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease 
•	ever_married: “No” or “Yes.” 
•	work_type: “children,” “Govt_jov,” “Never_worked,” “Private,” or “Self-employed.” 
•	Residence_type: “Rural” or “Urban” 
•	avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood 
•	BMI: body mass index 
•	smoking_status: “formerly smoked,” “never smoked,” “smokes,” or “Unknown”* 
•	stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not  

Note: “Unknown” in smoking_status means that the information is unavailable for this patient

Our main task is to determine the appropriate models with better performance on classification by comparing several models’ performance.
